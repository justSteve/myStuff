# Rear Ash Removal System - Design Document

**Bead**: myStuff-4q2
**Status**: Provisional design
**Last updated**: 2026-01-06

## Overview

Ash removal from the rear of the firebox, accessible from the wood storage room. Enables ash removal while fire is burning, with covered tray for safe transport.

## Design Concept

### Core Principle

Angled grate at rear of firebox that:
1. Starts flush with hearth floor (no drop-off/void)
2. Slopes upward toward back wall
3. Meets back wall 3-4" above hearth level
4. Creates shallow but wide trough beneath for ash collection

### How It Works

```

### Operational Flow

1. Ash accumulates in firebox during burn
2. User pushes ash toward rear with tool (poker, shovel)
3. Large coals/embers prop against upward-angled grate (can't roll back)
4. As material burns down and cools, ash falls through grate bars
5. Ash collects in trough beneath grate
6. Trough drains to removable tray
7. When full, tray is extracted from wood storage room
8. Cover mechanism seals tray during transport

## Dimensions (Provisional)

### Angled Grate
- **Width**: ~24-26" (nearly full firebox width)
- **Depth** (front-to-back): ~8"
- **Angle**: ~20-25° slope (creates 3-4" rise over 8" run)
- **Bar spacing**: 3/4" - 1" (holds embers, passes ash)
- **Bar orientation**: TBD (front-to-back vs. side-to-side)
- **Material**: Cast iron or heavy steel bar

### Trough
- **Width**: Same as grate (~24-26")
- **Depth** (front-to-back): ~8"
- **Height**: 4-5"
- **Volume**: ~24" x 8" x 4" = ~770 cubic inches
- **Material**: Steel plate, welded

### Ash Tray
- **Dimensions**: TBD based on trough geometry and access constraints
- **Material**: Heavy gauge steel, welded seams
- **Cover mechanism**: TBD (see options below)

```

## Cover Mechanism Options

### Option 1: Cam-Actuated Sliding Lid
Tray rides on rails. As tray is pulled out, cam/lever forces lid closed automatically.

### Option 2: Nested Tray + Outer Shell
Inner tray (ash) fits inside outer shell (with sliding lid). Pull entire assembly, lid closes. Take outside, lift inner tray to dump.

### Option 3: Guillotine Door
Weighted/spring-loaded door at chute exit. Door lifts when tray is pushed in, drops closed when tray is extracted, sealing the tray.

**Selection**: TBD - requires prototyping

## Integration Considerations

### Firebox Construction
- Grate and trough are structural elements of the firebox
- Must be designed alongside hearth masonry, not added after
- Grate frame may be cast iron or fabricated steel, set into refractory

### Secondary Combustion Chamber
- Both systems occupy the rear of the firebox
- Secondary combustion chamber sits ABOVE the ash system
- Smoke path goes up and back, ash path goes down and back
- No conflict if designed together

### Hydronic Heat Exchanger
- Heat exchanger likely in exhaust path (after secondary combustion)
- Ash system is below/separate from exhaust path
- No direct conflict

### Draft Considerations
- Trough/chute opening could affect draft
- May need damper or sealed tray interface to prevent cold air infiltration
- TBD based on final design

## Open Questions

1. **Bar orientation**: Front-to-back (parallel to slope) or side-to-side (perpendicular)?
2. **Grate construction**: Cast iron (foundry) or fabricated steel (welded)?
3. **Trough-to-tray interface**: Direct opening or chute with damper?
4. **Cover mechanism selection**: Need to prototype options
5. **Tray rail system**: Design for smooth extraction
6. **Seal at back wall**: How grate edge meets refractory

## Next Steps

1. Finalize grate dimensions after demolition confirms available space
2. Determine bar orientation and spacing
3. Prototype cover mechanism
4. Create detailed fabrication drawings
5. Source materials / get fabrication quotes

## Reference

This system is inspired by the front-loading ash drawer on wood furnaces, adapted for rear access given the fixed faceplate constraint.
